# Horiseon

## Description

This application was a part of my challenge 1 assignment for bootcamp. Within the application code I was able to clean up both the html and css. I replaced all non-semantic html tags with semantic tags for an easier read. I cleaned up the auto-generated css code by grouping the repetitive class selectors into one group, this was done for a couple different class selectors containing the repeated information. I left comments in both the html and css explaining sections/selectors that were changed. The deployed repository includes 3 main nav elements which have the ability to be clicked. When clicked, each specific element will automatically take the user to the section pertaining to the element. 


## Usage
