## Description

Within the application code I was able to clean up both the html and css. I replaced all non-semantic HTML tags with semantic tags for an easier read. I cleaned up the auto-generated CSS code by grouping the repetitive class selectors into one group, this was done for a couple different class selectors containing the repeated information. I left comments in both the HTML and CSS explaining sections/selectors that were changed. The deployed repository includes 3 main nav elements that have the ability to be clicked. When clicked, each specific element will automatically take the user to the section pertaining to the element.
